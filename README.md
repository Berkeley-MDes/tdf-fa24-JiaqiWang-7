# Week 1 #
## Week of 09/05/2024

### Reflections
  - reflections on what you learned and how you learned it
    - This week, I focused on orienting myself in this new environment and setting an optimal workflow. I searched for resources to stay up to date with the emerging technologies. I will curate a list of websites/blogs/plateforms as I go. The hope is to replace 50% of my time used on social media with these material.
        - [Times Magazine](https://time.com/tag/technology/)
        - [ACM Digital Libaray](https://dl.acm.org/)
        - [MIT News] (https://news.mit.edu/topic/research)
        - [MIT Media Lab Publication] (https://www.media.mit.edu/research/?filter=publications)
  - I tried out the laser cutter and made this keychain

### Speculations
  - AI will increasingly influence every aspect of our life. I recently ran into this [thesis paper from MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/cyborg-psychology/) about “Cyborg Psychology,” an interdisciplinary, human-centered approach to understanding how AI systems influence human psychological processes.

# Github Background Information & Context
If you’re new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that’s hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it’s super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I’m typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (💡 TIP: The .md indicates that we’re using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (💡 TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis 😄</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the “front page” of your GitHub repo. This is where we’ll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

Excited to work with you,
your TDF teaching team
