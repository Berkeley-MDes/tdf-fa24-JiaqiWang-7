  - Grasshopper Experiments
  - As a beginner to grasshopper, I first started to explore the files by moving the parameters. Some add-ons or plug-ins are not installed correctly so I cannot display the student and the activity data. Below are  some explorations from adjusting the parameters.

  - After the exploration, I made a diagram in figjam:

  - During class on Monday, we made this flow in GH that subtract a cylinder from a box.

  - After further exploring the grasshopper file, I used a more visual way of representing the process. Through sketching out how the geometry transforms, I realized that I didn't know how the cut on top of the sphere came from. Then, I discovered that the phone screen offset edge projects itself along the viewing angle with offset to subtract the void from the sphere base.

  - I decided that I want to make a phone stand for **video chat**, which means the phone needs to be oriented vertially. After adjusting the phone dimension to an iPhone 14 Plus, it became more difficult to find a design that passes all the test. This is one of the iteration that works.

  This structure looks really chuncky. I want to optimize it's structure.

  - I am curious about how to generate interesting structures with patterns in grasshopper. I found out an online-course about Grasshopper structure by Nolan Kim, a pattern, structural, and computational designer.
    - First, I am introduced to the idea of beam based structure.[more about structure](https://msestudent.com/what-is-the-difference-between-fcc-and-bcc-crystal-structure-properties-interstitial-sites-and-examples/)
    Here are some examples of how it is generated,constructed,and 3d printed.

# Week 1 #
## Week of 09/05/2024

### Reflections
  - reflections on what you learned and how you learned it
    - This week, I focused on orienting myself in this new environment and setting an optimal workflow. I searched for resources to stay up to date with the emerging technologies. I will curate a list of websites/blogs/plateforms as I go. The hope is to replace 50% of my time used on social media with these material.
        - [Times Magazine](https://time.com/tag/technology/)
        - [ACM Digital Libaray](https://dl.acm.org/)
        - [MIT News](https://news.mit.edu/topic/research)
        - [MIT Media Lab Publication](https://www.media.mit.edu/research/?filter=publications)
  - I tried out the laser cutter and made this keychain

### Speculations
  - AI will increasingly influence every aspect of our life. I recently ran into this [thesis paper from MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/cyborg-psychology/) about “Cyborg Psychology,” an interdisciplinary, human-centered approach to understanding how AI systems influence human psychological processes.

# Github Background Information & Context
If you’re new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that’s hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it’s super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I’m typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (💡 TIP: The .md indicates that we’re using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (💡 TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis 😄</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the “front page” of your GitHub repo. This is where we’ll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

# Example Report 1 #
## Week of 09/05/2024

This week, I designed a cool phone stand made of rocks. Check out all my cool sketches and progress photos from this week below, etc., etc....

It's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions, make a copy.  Also, feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

Excited to work with you,
your TDF teaching team

PS: let us know if you have any questions!!
