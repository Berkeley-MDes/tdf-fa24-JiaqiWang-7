# Hello DES INV 202 Student!
Welcome to your new GitHub repository! 

# Outline
[week 1](README.md#week-1)

[example](README.md#example-report-1)



# Week 1 #
## Week of 09/05/2024

### Reflections
  - reflections on what you learned and how you learned it
    - This week, I focused on orienting myself in this new environment and setting an optimal workflow. I searched for resources to stay up to date with the emerging technologies. I will curate a list of websites/blogs/plateforms as I go. The hope is to replace 50% of my time used on social media with these material.
        - [Times Magazine](https://time.com/tag/technology/)
        - etc
  - I tried out the laser cutter and made this keychain

### Speculations
  - in complete sentences or paragraphs, and perhaps images or videos.
  - speculation on future direction for the tools [so much is changing very quickly right now, where do you think this is going? Why do you think this?]
  - speculation on future direction for the work
  - bonus: thoughtful descriptions of something interesting and relevant you heard about in the news or industry publications. include text, an image, a link, and a reference that you can follow up on later and share with your peers.
### Images & Video
  - images & video should be unified with your presentation (not just a folder of images)
  - images & video should be directly relevant to the project (What does each shot show us?)
### Sketches, Drawings, and Diagrams
  - this could include flowcharts, design files, whiteboarding, storyboards, etc
  - pencil & paper sketches, drawings, post-its, etc (photographed or scanned and uploaded)

# Github Background Information & Context
If you’re new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that’s hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it’s super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I’m typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (💡 TIP: The .md indicates that we’re using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (💡 TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis 😄</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the “front page” of your GitHub repo. This is where we’ll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

It's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions, make a copy.  Also, feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

Excited to work with you,
your TDF teaching team
